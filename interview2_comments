I was happy to see that you were well prepared for the presentation

You were able to answer my questions well.
The demo was good.
You addressed issues of design and implementation without my prompts
-- excellent! I appreciated the thoughtful and informed design decisions
you presented.
You were able to learn a state-of-the-art technology in the course of
